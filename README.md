# Autonomous-Camera-Motion (WIP)

This repository contains the dataset built to validate a situation aware system for autonomous camera navigation during suturing in robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery. Please, be aware that the dataset is composed by the csv files contained in the Dataset folder: every file is anonymized. Recordings are kept private: they will be released upon request for research purposes only. This is a safety measure to protect the users involved in the study.
