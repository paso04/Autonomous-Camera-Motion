# Autonomous-Camera-Motion

This repository contains the dataset built to validate a situation aware system for autonomous camera navigation during suturing in robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery. The dataset comprehends synchronized kinematic data coming from two robotic arms, used as surgical tools, and a camera holder, used to change the field of view during the surgical task. Please, be aware that the dataset is composed by the csv files contained in the Dataset folder: every file is anonymized. Recordings are kept private: they will be released upon request for research purposes only. They will be shared as ROSBAG files: they contain the timestamps to synchronize every frame with the corresponding kinematic data. This is a safety measure to protect the users involved in the study.
