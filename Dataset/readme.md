(WIP)

Welcome in the Dataset section!

Here you can find the csv files containing the labeled kinematic data for online gesture recognition, synchronized with suturing videos (available upon request in ROSBAG files, with timestamps).

These gestures have been used to train several LSTM based NN models for surgical gesture recognition with non-expert users.
