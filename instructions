SOURCE: you can permanently source using gedit and adding two rows of source

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roscd dvrk_config/
rosrun dvrk_robot dvrk_console_json -j jhu-daVinci/console-SUJ-ECM-MTMR-PSM1-MTML-PSM2-Teleop.json

qtcreator to open the ide

roscore

1.Open terminal (already sourced)

2.Check if the wires are plugged in (it may me possible that 0 1 is connected but others not, so  if it doesn't function double check the others):
	qladisp 0 1

NB: if wires are not plugged, check the gray wire with red plug and connect it to control unit 0 1 WITH THE U SHAPE POINTING THE ROOF.

3.Change folder:
	cd catkin_ws/src/cisst-saw/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/share/jhu-daVinci/
or	roscd dvrk_config/jhu-daVinci/

4.In order to run the desired console, type (double tab to see options):
	rosrun dvrk_robot dvrk_console_json -j console-SUJ-ECM-MTMR-PSM1-MTML-PSM2-Teleop.json

4.1.Check if the tool selected is the correct one (usually large needle driver)

5.Once the console is open, power on. If it returns errors, let's open another terminal and type:
	qlacommand -c close-relays

6.Retry powering on. If it gives an inconsistency error, CLOSE CONSOLE and then type in the new terminal:
	qlacommand -c reset-encoder-preload

After the reset, open again the console (point 4) and power on. Done this, press home, then teleop.

7. In a new terminal type:
	rostopic list

ROSBAG

1. Per registrare un topic specifico:
	rosbag record <topic name> -O filename.bag

2. Se vuoi registrare tutti i topic:
	rosbag record -a -O filename.bag

3. rosbag record /PSM1/measured_cp /PSM1/measured_cv /PSM2/measured_cp /PSM2/measured_cv /ECM/measured_cp /ECM/measured_cv /MTMR/gripper/closed /MTML/gripper/closed /footpedals/clutch /footpedals/camera -O user_1.bag

VIDEO

1. Go to:
	https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-ros/blob/master/dvrk_robot/video.md
	
	for the original documentation
2. It's preferrable to run the gstream on the computer on the right:
	roslaunch dvrk_robot jhu_daVinci_video.launch

3. Then on th eleft computer:
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://lcsr-dv-stereo:11311

	with this command you are pointing to the computer on the right 	(whenever running a roscore you can look at this information, the 		port)

4. If you want to point back at your location:
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

5. After point 3. type:
	rosrun image_view image_view image:=/jhu_daVinci/right/decklink/camera/image_raw
	rosrun image_view image_view image:=/jhu_daVinci/left/decklink/camera/image_raw
